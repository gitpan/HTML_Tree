	HTML Tree
	C++ library for parsing and HTML file into a DOM-like tree
	________________________________________________________________

	HTML Tree is a C++ library for parsing an HTML file into a
	DOM-like (Document Object Model) tree.  Once created, nodes in
	the tree (HTML elements and text) can be modified.  The modified
	tree can then be output.  This allows an HTML file to be used as
	a template for the generation of dynamic web pages.

	Additionally, there is also a Perl extension (XS layer) and an
	Apache mod_perl module.
